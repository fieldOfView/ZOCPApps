h1. ZOCP standard input output (stdio)

This is a simple application which listens on stdin and sends anything it receives as a signal.

For example to listen for new content in a file /tmp/test we can use the command 'tail' and pipe it to zstdio:

<pre>
tail -f /tmp/test | zstdio
</pre>

Anything that gets written in that file will be send out as a signal, ie.:

<pre>
echo "hello" >> /tmp/test
</pre>

Will result in a signal containing the word "hello"

h1. What is stdio?

See "wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams

Basically it's a standardized input output system used in POSIX compatible Operating Systems. It's very handy to chain programs together which is very simple on the command line (terminal) using the '|' (pipe) symbol, i.e.:

<pre>
$ cat README.textile | grep wikipedia
See "wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams
</pre> 
'cat' Is a very simple program that outputs any file. 'grep' Is a very simple program to look for a pattern.

StdIO in shell like Bash is very powerful. Just Google for some tutorials.
